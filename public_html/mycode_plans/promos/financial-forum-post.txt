If you have student loans, a car payment, or credit card debt and want to actually understand what you're paying, I made some free calculators at https://www.oldweb.tech/financials

The site helps you see what's really happening with your money. The amortization calculator shows you how much of your payment goes to interest vs the actual loan (spoiler: way more than you think at first). The debt payoff comparison shows whether you should pay off your highest interest debt first or knock out the small ones for motivation.

There's also a compound interest calculator so you can see how saving even a little bit regularly actually adds up over time, and a retirement calculator if you want to figure out how much you need to save to stop working eventually.

Everything is free, runs in your browser, and works offline. No signup, no tracking. You can mess around with the numbers to see different scenarios without affecting anything real. It helped me wrap my head around my own loans and figure out an actual plan instead of just making minimum payments forever.

The tools also explain the concepts as you go, so you're not just plugging in numbers without understanding what they mean.
