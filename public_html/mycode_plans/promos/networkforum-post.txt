I built a collection of web utilities that might be useful if you work in networking or sysadmin. It's at https://www.oldweb.tech
The site has the usual suspects: subnet calculators (IPv4/IPv6), CIDR converters, chmod calculator, cron builder, regex tester, password generator, and a handful of data tools like base64 encoding and hash generators. There's also an amortization calculator because why not.
Everything runs in your browser with no backend, so it works offline once you load it. No tracking, no analytics, no account signup. Just open it and use it. The tools are pretty fast since everything is client side. You can even save a tool/page to your computer and use it in a secure facility that's air gapped.
I made it because I got tired of hunting down these utilities across different sites or waiting for bloated pages to load when I just needed to quickly convert something or check a subnet mask.
If you bookmark it, it's there when you need it. Works on mobile too but obviously better on desktop.
